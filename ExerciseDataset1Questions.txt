Please read the below paragraph before attempting the questions to get a better idea about the dataset.

"A Team of Data Analysts from West Bengal planned to survey on the people of the state West Bengal, India and managed to collect some datapoints initially. With a hardwork of more than 1 year they managed to collect some datapoints. Some information such as <DateOfBirth> required evidences to attach by the user as well. Manual surveys are so time-consuming, hence they took help from a web-application to reach people in order to fill up the details by them when they're comfortable. From Monday to Fridays went hectic with their past 1 year with other projects, so they want your help to find out answers from this dataset. Also feel free to share any other observations apart from the asked questions if you want. I have their contacts, on any issues please reach out to me, will pass them."
