# ExerciseDataset1
This is a dummy dataset I designed along with some questions to practice data analysis for beginners(Students in School or University). if you're one interested you have to find out the answers of the questions investigating on the dataset provided. Feel free to use any set of tools you're comfortable with. Please note that, this is a dummy dataset created with a purpose of imitating an original one as much as possible, so to answer some of the questions you may require to think out of the box(I mean the DataSet!) and use some external information(From Google maybe!) and common sense. Explaining the approach you took and assumptions you made(if any, with evidence) while answering each question is highly encouranged. All the best and wish you luck!
