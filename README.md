# ExerciseDataset1
This is a dummy dataset I designed along with some questions to practice data analysis for beginners(Students in School or University). You have to find out the answers of the questions investigating on the dataset provided. Feel free to use any tools you're comfortable with. Please note that, this is a dummy data created with a purpose of imitating an original dataset as much as possible, so to answer some of the questions you may require to think out of the box(I mean the DataSet!) and use some external information(From Google maybe!) and common sense. All the best and wish you luck!
